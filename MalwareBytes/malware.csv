https://blog.malwarebytes.com/reports/2020/09/smb-cybersecurity-posture-weakened-by-covid-19/,"In August, Malwarebytes Labs analyzed the damage caused by COVID-19 to business cybersecurity. Because of immediate, mandated transitions to working from home (WFH), businesses across the United States suffered more data breaches, lost more dollars, and increased their overall attack surfaces, all while experiencing a worrying lack of cybersecurity awareness on behalf of workers and IT and security directors.Today, we have parsed the data to understand the pandemic’s effect on, specifically, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).The data on SMB cybersecurity is troubling.Despite smart maneuvering by some SMBs—like those that provided cybersecurity trainings focused on WFH threats, or those that refrained from rolling out a new software tool because of its security or privacy risks—28 percent of SMBs still paid unexpected expenses to address a malware attack, and 22 percent suffered a security breach due to a remote worker.Those numbers are higher than the averages we found for companies of all sizes in August—by a respective 4 percent and 2 percent.The numbers don’t look good. But perhaps more worrying than the actions that befell our respondents are the actions they might fail to take themselves. For example, while a majority of SMBs said that they planned to install a more permanent WFH model for employees in the future, the same number of SMBs said they did not plan to deploy an antivirus solution that can specifically protect those distributed workforces. Further, while SMBs widely agreed that they were using more video conferencing, online communication, and cloud storage platforms during WFH—thus expanding their online attack surface—a worrying number of respondents said they did not complete any cybersecurity or online privacy reviews of those software tools before making them available to employees. Thankfully, there are some basic steps that SMBs can take in the coming weeks and months to better protect themselves and their employees:The cybersecurity posture of organizations of all sizes, including SMBs, can and should be taken seriously—especially as WFH becomes the new normal.Today’s data represents a follow-up to our August report, Enduring from Home: COVID-19’s Impact on Business Security, in which we surveyed more than 200 IT and cybersecurity executives, directors, and managers from businesses of all sizes. Our analysis today takes a magnifying glass to the more than 100 respondents who work for companies that have between 100 and 1,249 employees. We separated the data into three bands according to company size: companies with 100–349 employees; companies with 350–699 employees; and companies with 700–1,249 employees.At times, certain patterns or unique findings emerged within those bands.For example, larger SMBs had far greater concerns about the effectiveness of a remote IT workforce. When asked about their biggest cybersecurity concerns with employees now working remotely, 50 percent of respondents working at companies with 700–1,249 employees said “our IT support may not be as effective in supporting remote workers.” Respondents from smaller organizations, however, were not as concerned. Only 27.3 percent of respondents from the smallest businesses we surveyed (100–349 employees ) and 21.6 percent of midsized companies (350–699 employees) answered the same.Intuitively, this makes sense—larger companies have more employees and more potential opportunities for ad-hoc cybersecurity and IT issues that should be addressed. But without an office, those issues might be ignored by employees. Similarly, those issues might become so frequent that they overwhelm remote IT workers.Elsewhere in the data, in at least one situation, we found a potential correlation between company size and pandemic impact.Like we said above, across all SMBs, 28 percent said they paid unexpected expenses to address a malware attack.But that percentage increased depending on the size of the company affected. Surprise malware expenses hit 21.2 percent of companies with 100–349 employees, 29.7 percent of companies with 350–699 employees, and 30.4 percent of companies with 700–1,249 employees.Maybe, then, there is some truth to the age-old saying: They bigger they are, the harder they fall.In fact, that idea bore some truth when we broadened the analysis of our data. By comparing the responses of SMBs to the responses of enterprise companies—which, in our data, included companies with 1,250–4,999 employees, and companies with 5,000 or more employees—we found that large enterprises were more likely to report financial damages, but less likely to report cybersecurity damages.The starkest differences can be found in the 60.5 percent of enterprise respondents who said they froze all or nearly all hiring compared to the 50.9 precent of SMBs who said the same; the 43 percent of enterprise respondents who said they froze all or nearly all promotions and pay raises compared to the 33.6 percent of SMBs; and the 29.1 percent of enterprise respondents who said they lost contracts or clients, compared to the 21.6 percent of SMBs.However, enterprise respondents were far less likely to say they paid unexpected expenses to address a malware attack—18.6 percent versus 27.6 percent of SMBs—and they were slightly less likely to say they faced a security breach due to a remote worker—16.3 percent versus 22.4 percent of SMBs.It’s difficult to pinpoint why enterprise companies proved more resilient to cybersecurity damages—they said they performed cybersecurity and online privacy reviews of new software tools, deployed new antivirus tools, and provided WFH-tailored cybersecurity trainings at nearly the same rates as SMBs, and, surprisingly, enterprise respondents said they urged employees to use an antivirus tool on personal devices at a dramatically lower rate—29.1 percent of enterprise companies compared to 45.7 percent of SMBs.The one sticking point, however, may be in device usage. Enterprise respondents used their personal devices less frequently for work than their SMB counterparts, with just 20.9 percent of respondents saying they now used their personal devices for work more than work-issued devices, compared with 32.8 percent of SMB respondents.The immediate transition to WFH hit businesses everywhere, no matter their size. With no preparation time and sometimes lacking clarity from local and state governments for what was considered safe, businesses were forced to chart their own paths.Despite these pressures, many SMBs rose to the occasion to protect their businesses and their employees, while also providing their workers with the tools and software necessary to succeed in their roles.For example, 58.2 percent of respondents said their business provided work-issued devices as needed, and 41.4 percent said their business deployed previously unused software tools to maintain communication and productivity. Further, 56.9 percent of respondents said their business performed a cybersecurity and online privacy analysis of newly deployed software tools, while 21.6 percent said that those reviews led to a decision to not deploy a software tool.Finally, 55.2 percent of respondents said their business provided cybersecurity trainings focused on the specific cybersecurity threats of WFH, with information on the importance of secured home networks, strong passwords, and unauthorized device access.As SMBs showed promising action in the immediate transition to WFH, they also responded with encouraging preparations for the future.More than half—56.9 percent—of respondents said their business would “develop stronger remote security policies,” 50 percent said their business would “host more cybersecurity trainings tailored for working from home,” and 48.2 percent said their business would “develop cybersecurity and online privacy reviews for new, necessary software in the transition to working from home.”That last point is a welcome one. Though, as we showed, 56.9 percent of respondents said their business “performed a cybersecurity and online privacy analysis of any newly-deployed software tools,” those reviews may have been ad-hoc. Codifying these types of reviews into a broader set of policies is a good practice.While all of these are encouraging trends, we cannot neglect some of the more worrying data points. In fact, one of our survey respondents accurately described some of same risks that we uncovered.“Employees are not as vigilant as they would be working from home about potential cyberattacks,” said a Florida IT director at a company of 100–349 employees. “We’ve seen some lax efforts from some of our better more observant employees in the last few months.”In our main report in August, we found potential cases of security hubris—the simple phenomenon in which a business believes it is more secure than it actually is. In our deeper analysis of SMB cybersecurity, similar trends emerged.For example, when we asked SMB respondents to rank their preparedness to transition to WFH on a scale from 1–10, a majority ranked themselves highly—62 percent gave their business an 8 or higher, and 74.1 percent gave their business a 7 or higher.However, our respondents’ actual transition to WFH did not involve the type of preparation and cybersecurity protection that would typically warrant such high evaluations. Yes, 55.2 percent said they provided cybersecurity trainings focused on the specific cybersecurity threats of WFH, but think about the 44.8 percent who did not respond that way. Yes, 57 percent said they performed a cybersecurity and online privacy analysis of new software tools, but that likely means that more than 40 percent did not. Also, only 34.5 percent of respondents said they deployed a new antivirus tool for devices provided by the organization, which leaves us scratching our heads about the roughly 65 percent who did not say the same. What gives?Amidst the transition to WFH, our SMB respondents entirely agreed on one aspect—they are using more tools, more frequently.We found that 81.9 percent of SMB respondents said that their usage of video conferencing platforms, like Zoom, and Microsoft Teams, had increased “slightly more” or “significantly more,” 75 percent said the same about their increased use of online instant messaging platforms, and 69.8 percent said the same about their increased use of cloud storage platforms. Relatedly, 33 percent of respondents said they are using personal devices for work more often than their work-issued device, compared to the time before the pandemic.Put into perspective, more software tools being used more frequently, with some employees reporting more frequent personal device usage, all points to one big problem—an increased attack surface.And yet, even with this hard data showing an increased attack surface, 65.5 percent of respondents said their organizations were at least “equally secure” as they were before the pandemic; within those numbers, 35.4 percent went further, saying their business was actually “slightly more” or “significantly more” secure.On our podcast Lock and Code, security evangelist and Malwarebytes Labs director Adam Kujawa explained why these positions are likely impossible to square.“For the most part, I don’t see how people can actually say they’re more secure,” Kujawa said about the results from our broader COVID-19 report in August. “There may be an idea that, because folks are distributed—because remote workers are no longer located in a single, physical space—that they are somehow decentralized, and therefor harder to gain access to by cybercriminals.”Kujawa continued: “The reality is that that is complete baloney.”The clearest discrepancy between the words and the actions of SMBs came in the responses to their future. When asked about future plans to protect their businesses, 54.3 percent of SMB respondents said they would “install a more permanent work-from-home model for employees who do not need to be in the office every day.” However, just 38.8 percent said they would “deploy an antivirus solution that can better handle a more dispersed, remote workforce.”This is disappointing because it seems so obvious. Any plans to install a more permanent workforce must include plans to protect that workforce.Protecting a business from cybersecurity attacks is difficult. Protecting a business during a pandemic, with employees dispersed across multiple geographies, is only harder.Like we said above, there are several steps that SMBs can take in the near future to better protect themselves and their employees.SMBs should provide cybersecurity trainings that are relevant to employees’ job responsibilities. Blanket cybersecurity policies rarely grab any employees’ attention, which could lead to lapses in cybersecurity hygiene.Also, it’s a good idea to considering installing a more permanent WFH solution today, because, when the pandemic finally does end, your business will get a boost in cybersecurity posture even if employees are working remotely for other purposes, like traveling for conferences.Finally, since we found that SMBs were more likely to suffer a security breach because of a remote worker, seriously, consider rolling out an antivirus solution that can protect those employees. We understand that cybersecurity is hard, and that the budget pressures of SMBs are unique, but small- and medium-sized businesses should not have to risk higher threats of breaches just because of their sizes. Further, since SMBs reported far higher increases in personal device usage for work-related activities, they could also consider urging employees to use an antivirus solution on those devices.Companies can come in many, many sizes, but none of those sizes are too small to care about cybersecurity.Remember to read the full report for more information.  Provide cybersecurity trainings that are tailored not just for the threats of WFH, but also the threats that employees may face depending on their job responsibilities and the level of access they have within the businessInstall long-term online privacy and cybersecurity reviews, remembering to review internal products—which may necessitate additional employee access points—as much as new, external software toolsDeploy an antivirus solution that can better handle a remote workforce"
https://blog.malwarebytes.com/reports/2020/08/20-percent-of-organizations-experienced-breach-due-to-remote-worker-labs-report-reveals/,"It is no surprise that moving to a fully remote work environment due to COVID-19 would cause a number of changes in organizations’ approaches to cybersecurity. What has been surprising, however, are some of the unanticipated shifts in employee habits and how they have impacted the security posture of businesses large and small. Our latest Malwarebytes Labs report, Enduring from Home: COVID-19’s Impact on Business Security, reveals some unexpected data about security concerns with today’s remote workforce.Our report combines Malwarebytes product telemetry with survey results from 200 IT and cybersecurity decision makers from small businesses to large enterprises, unearthing new security concerns that surfaced after the pandemic forced US businesses to send their workers home. The data showed that since organizations moved to a work from home (WFH) model, the potential for cyberattacks and breaches has increased. While this isn’t entirely unexpected, the magnitude of this increase is surprising. Since the start of the pandemic, 20 percent of respondents said they faced a security breaches as a result of a remote worker. This in turn has increased costs, with 24 percent of respondents saying they paid unexpected expenses to address a cybersecurity breach or malware attack following shelter-in-place orders.We noticed a stark increase in the use of personal devices for work: 28 percent of respondents admitted they’re using personal devices for work-related activities more than their work-issued devices. Beyond that, we found that 61 percent of respondents’ organizations did not urge employees to use antivirus solutions on their personal devices, further compounding the increase in attack surface with a lack of adequate protection.We found a startling contrast between the IT leaders’ confidence in their security during the transition to work from home (WFH) environments, and their actual security postures, demonstrating a continued problem of security hubris. Roughly three quarters (73.2 percent) of our survey respondents gave their organizations a score of 7 or above on preparedness for the transition to WFH, yet 45 percent of respondents’ organizations did not perform security and online privacy analyses of necessary software tools for WFH collaboration.To learn more about the increasing risks uncovered in today’s remote workforce population, read our full report:Enduring from Home: COVID-19’s Impact on Business Security18 percent of respondents admitted that, for their employees, cybersecurity was not a priority, while 5 percent said their employees were a security risk and oblivious to security best practices.At the same time, 44 percent of respondents’ organizations did not provide cybersecurity training that focused on potential threats of working from home (like ensuring home networks had strong passwords, or devices were not left within reach of non-authorized users).While 61 percent of respondents’ organizations provided work-issued devices to employees as needed, 65 percent did not deploy a new antivirus (AV) solution for those same devices."

Our report, “Cybercrime tactics and techniques: Attack on home base,” analyzes the trojans, info stealers, and botnets that threat actors delivered to increasingly more homes from January to March of this year.Our report looks at more than attack volume, though. It also captures the actual models that threat actors used to try and trick unsuspecting victims. From an email purporting to come fom UNICEF, to another claiming to contain information about proper face mask usage, to a much-discussed, fraudulent map posing as a legitimate, global coronavirus case tracker from John Hopkins University—it’s all here in our latest report.Malwarebytes researchers have been following these attack methods for months.We found a scam email that preyed on individuals’ desire to offer support during the pandemic. We investigated activity from a reported Pakistani state-sponsored threat actor spreading a remote access Trojan through a coronavirus-themed spearphishing campaign. We discovered countless impersonating emails and snake-oil pitches hiding a variety of keyloggers, ransomware, and data stealers.In today’s report, we now have the data to show what malware threats, specifically, increased in the first three months of 2020.To learn more about the attack methods and malware types targeting individuals today, and to find recommendations on how to protect your—and your remote employees’—home base, read the full report:Cybercrime tactics and techniques: Attack on home baseCybercriminals quickly transitioned to delivering years-old malware with brand new campaigns that preyed on the confusion, fear, and uncertainty surrounding the global coronavirus pandemic.Malwarebytes discovered that the backdoor malware NetWiredRC, which laid low for roughly five months in 2019, dramatically increased its activity at the start of 2020, with a detection increase of at least 200 percent by March compared to last December.The time period between January and February was, for several of the malware types analyzed, a precursor to even greater, increased detection activity between February and March.Malwarebytes recorded increased detections of nearly 110 percent between February and March for the malware AveMaria, a dangerous remote access trojan that can provide remote desktop access and remote webcam control, with the additional ability to steal passwords.Malwarebytes recorded increased detections of more than 160 percent between February and March for the malware DanaBot, an invasive trojan and information stealer that can swipe online banking account credentials.Phishing campaigns appear to be the most popular attack method, but cybercriminals have also gotten creative with fraudulent websites that hide malware.A 26 percent increase in credit card skimming activity in March puts home shoppers at greater risk"

It so happens we’ve got just the right content to kick-start the party because today we released the results of our annual study on the state of malware—the 2020 State of Malware Report—and as usual, it’s a doozy.From an increase in enterprise-focused threats to the diversification of sophisticated hacking and stealth techniques, the 2019 threat landscape was shaped by a cybercrime industry that aimed to show it’s all grown up and coming after organizations with increasing vengeance.The 2020 State of Malware Report features data sets collected from product telemetry, honey pots, intelligence, and other research conducted by Malwarebytes threat analysts and reporters to investigate the top threats delivered by cybercriminals to both consumers and businesses in 2019. Our analysis includes a look at threats to Mac and Windows PCs, Android and iOS, as well as browser-based attacks. In addition, we examined consumer and business detections on threats to specific regions and industries across the globe. Finally, we took a look at the state of data privacy in 2019, including state and federal legislation, as well as the privacy failures of some big tech companies in juxtaposition against the forward-thinking policies of others.Here’s a sample of what we found:To learn more about the top threats of the year for Mac, Windows, Android, and the web, as well as the state of data privacy in commerce and legislation, check out the full 2020 State of Malware Report here.Mac threats increased exponentially in comparison to those against Windows PCs. While overall volume of Mac threats increased year-over-year by more than 400 percent, that number is somewhat impacted by a larger Malwarebytes for Mac userbase in 2019. However, when calculated in threats per endpoint, Macs still outpaced Windows by nearly 2:1.The volume of global threats against business endpoints has increased by 13 percent year-over-year, with aggressive adware, Trojans, and HackTools leading the pack.Organizations were once again hammered with Emotet and TrickBot, two Trojan-turned-botnets that surfaced in the top five threats for nearly every region of the globe, and in the top detections for the services, retail, and education industries. TrickBot detections in particular increased more than 50 percent over the previous year.Net new ransomware activity is at an all-time high against businesses, with families such as Ryuk and Sodinokibi increasing by as much as 543 and 820 percent, respectively."

Over the last year, we gathered global data from our product telemetry, honeypots, threat intelligence, and research efforts, focusing on the top threat categories and families that plagued the medical industry, as well as the most common attack vectors used by cybercriminals to penetrate healthcare defenses. What we found is that healthcare-targeted cybercrime is a growing sector, with threats increasing in volume and severity while highly-valuable patient data remains unguarded. With a combination of unsecured electronic healthcare records (EHR) spread over a broad attack surface, cybercriminals are cashing in on industry negligence, exploiting vulnerabilities in unpatched legacy software and social engineering unaware hospital staff into opening malicious emails—inviting infections into the very halls constructed to beat them.Our report explores the security challenges inherent to all healthcare organizations, from small private practices to enterprise HMOs, as well as the devastating consequences of criminal infiltration on patient care. Finally, we look ahead to innovations in biotech and the need to consider security in their design and implementation.Some of the key takeaways from our report: To learn more about the cyberthreats facing healthcare and our recommendations for improving the industry’s security posture, read the full report:Cybercrime tactics and techniques: the 2019 state of healthcareThe medical sector is currently ranked as the seventh-most targeted global industry according to Malwarebytes telemetry gathered from October 2018 through September 2019.Threat detections have increased for this vertical from about 14,000 healthcare-facing endpoint detections in Q2 2019 to more than 20,000 in Q3, a growth rate of 45 percent.The medical industry is overwhelmingly targeted by Trojan malware, which increased by 82 percent in Q3 2019 over the previous quarter. While Emotet detections surged at the beginning of 2019, TrickBot took over in the second half as the number one threat to healthcare today.The healthcare industry is a target for cybercriminals for several reasons, including their large databases of EHRs, lack of sophisticated security model, and high number of endpoints and other devices connected to the network. Consequences of a breach for the medical industry far outweigh any other organization, as stolen or modified patient data can put a stop to critical procedures, and devices locked out due to ransomware attack can result in halted operations—and sometimes even patient death.New innovations in biotech, including cloud-based biometrics, genetic research, and even advances in prosthetics could broaden the attack surface on healthcare and result in far-reaching, dire outcomes if security isn’t baked into their design and implementation."
