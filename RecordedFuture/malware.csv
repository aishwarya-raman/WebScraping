                The Recorded Future Team            From lawyers, to marketing agencies, to office supply providers, your organization relies on third parties to keep the business in business. While critical to continued success, every vendor introduces risk to your organization. Multiply that risk by 583 (the number of vendors the average company shares confidential information with), and it’s easy to see why third-party risk teams have their hands full. Growing regulatory mandates, a surging skills shortage, ineffectual procurement and vendor assessment practices, and dangerous visibility gaps create a perfect storm for security issues stemming from supply chains.To tackle these challenges, third-party risk management teams need a way to understand, monitor, measure, and reduce their organization’s real-time exposure to third-party risk. They also need to take a critical look at their current exposure, coverage, and controls in order to chart their path forward. This begins with asking some tough — but important — questions, such as, Which vendors are most critical to my organization?” And, “If I bring this vendor on board, what are we legally accountable for if there’s a breach?”Positioning security intelligence at the core of your third-party risk mitigation strategy enables you to track dynamic changes to your vendors’ risk profiles, understand which relationships are the riskiest, and prioritize efforts to amplify impact. Elite third-party intelligence from Recorded Future enables teams across your organization to address the many security challenges that third-party relationships present to the business, including:Use this short e-book to explore five critical questions about your approach to third-party risk. Answering each question honestly is your first step to effectively defend your organization against the weakest links in your supply chain.

                The Recorded Future Team            Industry analysts have characterized threat intelligence as evidence-based, actionable assessments about existing or emerging threats. At Recorded Future, we’ve taken this notion to the next level. Elite threat intelligence is not only evidence-based and actionable — it moves at the speed and scale of the internet, enabling quick and confident decision-making. It empowers analysts to detect threats, mitigate risks, and secure organizations with unprecedented speed and scalability. Today, the biggest challenge plaguing threat intelligence analysts is lack of time. Whether you’re investigating threats in your technology stack or hunting for emerging attack methods on the dark web, you’re probably spending too much time manually collecting, categorizing, and analyzing disparate data points into actionable intelligence. With the majority of your time being spent on manual analysis, there’s not much room for the high-impact research, investigation, and reporting necessary to disrupt adversaries. This lack of time has a downstream effect for the entire security organization, leading to incomplete analysis, stale reporting, and missed threats. To successfully reduce risk, you need to move at least as fast (but ideally faster) than threat actors — and today’s attackers are especially wiley. They evolve their methods at unprecedented speed. Manually derived threat intelligence doesn’t cut it, because it often becomes stale as soon as it’s published. This also leads to fatigue. Most analysts are so bogged down, that they are physically unable to manually investigate each suspicious indicator they come across. This leaves organizations at risk and, in some cases, unaware of critical and emerging threats.By collecting data and information from an unrivaled breadth and variety of sources, Recorded Future eliminates manual research and surfaces intelligence in real time — providing organizations with a dynamic and comprehensive view of their threat landscape. Without manual tasks weighing them down, analysts are empowered to focus on the high-value tasks for which they are trained: advanced threat research, detection, and validation.Recorded Future’s Security Intelligence Platform automatically collects and analyzes data from an unrivaled range of sources in all languages. The Threat Intelligence Module provides analysts with a comprehensive view of their threat landscape through high-speed, automated analysis, expert insights from Recorded Future’s research group, and advanced search capabilities. Armed with elite threat intelligence, analysts are empowered to:Defending against new and emerging attacks requires timely, relevant insights updated in real time.

                The Recorded Future Team            As the attack surface grows, security operations and incident response teams are seeing more and more security alerts each day. With too little time and not enough information, it’s difficult to determine where to focus first for maximum risk reduction. Analysts spend many valuable cycles looking for information on the open and dark web to find only incomplete pieces of what they need — resulting in missed threats and slow responses.For years, these teams have relied on security technology to collect, correlate, and analyze security event logs from a variety of sources across their network environments. These tools were built to help them quickly detect and respond to threats, while streamlining reporting and post-incident investigation. Yet, as organizations continue to embrace new technologies to fuel their digital transformations, the attack surface continues to expand and the volume of security alerts puts more stress on already overworked security professionals. Security operations and incident response teams face the following key challenges with their SIEM, SOAR, TIP technologies: Recorded Future’s SecOps Intelligence Module enables security operations and incident response analysts to identify previously unknown threats and respond confidently — without any manual research. Recorded Future automates the collection, analysis, and production of elite security intelligence at scale to drive accelerated responses across vast amounts of data. By centralizing and continuously updating intelligence in real time, the Recorded Future Security Intelligence Platform empowers security operations and incident response analysts to immediately access and easily integrate actionable context into SIEM, SOAR, and TIP technologies.Armed with real-time risk scores and key evidence for indicators, security operations and incident response analysts are able to quickly discount false positives, determine which alerts to prioritize, and easily dive into more information when further investigation is required. By eliminating the need to manually aggregate, correlate, and analyze information, Recorded Future’s SecOps Intelligence Module empowers analysts to:SecOps intelligence accelerates detection, decision-making, and response times by positioning elite intelligence at the center of your security workflows and technologies. See the Recorded Future SecOps Intelligence Module in action right now, See Recorded Future’s SecOps Intelligence Module in action right now — watch the short, on-demand webinar, “Disrupting Adversaries With SecOps Intelligence.”September 3, 2020September 1, 2020August 26, 2020August 11, 2020August 4, 2020The Challenge With SIEMs: Alert Fatigue — SIEMs generate thousands of security alerts each day. This is far too much information for analysts to research and process manually. And without outside context, SIEMs only alert on internal data — leaving organizations unaware of external threats that could be targeting them. To effectively respond to the multitude of SIEM alerts generated each day, security operations analysts need a way to prioritize alerts efficiently in order to maximize risk reduction.The Challenge With SOARs: Automation Without Action — Orchestration and automation are key drivers for digital transformation, enabling organizations to optimize existing processes, reduce costs, fill personnel gaps, and gain a competitive edge. Recognizing these clear benefits, security teams are embracing security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) technology to collect and analyze threat data from multiple sources and automate repeatable incident response tasks. But, for SOAR solutions to work effectively, they require a series of defined playbooks designed to describe threats and how to handle them using automated security workflows. These playbooks are only as smart and effective as the data used to construct them. Without actionable, real-time data on active and emerging threats, it’s impossible to effectively and proactively reduce risk.The Challenge With TIPs: Manual Analysis — Analysts are expected to gain and maintain situational awareness of their external threat landscape, but this requires high-quality, real-time intelligence from multiple sources. TIPs provide an avenue for consolidating and integrating this overwhelming amount of threat data, but for TIPs to be truly effective, they also require security teams to have the expertise to analyze the data and identify trends relevant to their organization. A TIP is only as good as the intelligence you feed it, so analysts must prioritize intelligence sources that will enable them to optimize their workflows and decision-making.Triage Alerts Faster — Analysts are inherently limited by how much research they’re able to perform for a given alert. There are only so many sources they have time to consult before they need to come to a verdict. SecOps intelligence empowers analysts to see which alerts need to be prioritized based on a real-time risk score that is backed by transparent evidence.Detect Threats Confidently — The explosive growth of indicators makes detecting real threats extremely resource-intensive for already overwhelmed security teams. SecOps intelligence connects the dots between the broadest range and variety of sources across every language. This intelligence and critical context enables analysts to automatically analyze and identify IOCs related to phishing attacks, malware, and more — empowering security teams to automate responses and reduce risk for the organization.Prevent Threats Instantly — With so many indicators, threat feeds have to be high confidence and high fidelity in order to be actionable. SecOps intelligence arms them with proprietary, evidence-based findings to automatically block high-risk indicators to minimize false positive blocking, automate incident response, and improve overall security posture.Company

                The Recorded Future Team            Your brand is your organization’s backbone when it comes to building your customers’ trust and maintaining their loyalty. Typosquat websites, data and credential leaks, and command-and-control attacks are just a few examples of how threat actors may attack your brand. And the repercussions are devastating — ranging from lost credibility with customers, to widespread distrust, to massive financial losses. Protecting your brand is critical. However, more often than not, organizations are blindsided by cyberattacks targeting their brand. That’s because most security professionals have limited visibility outside of their own organizations’ network — and zero visibility into the nefarious corners of the web where cybercriminals are known to plan and launch attacks. Too frequently, analysts spend valuable time pouring over disconnected keyword-based data points to find cyberattacks that have already begun chipping away at their brand’s integrity. An effective brand protection solution shouldn’t merely hack together old data points — it needs to deliver relevant and contextual intelligence to prevent attacks from happening in the first place. Many organizations start building their strategy around a brand monitoring solution only to eventually learn that it doesn’t sufficiently protect their brand. Brand monitoring solutions are great for surfacing mentions of your brand on open web sources. However, simply monitoring for brand mentions isn’t enough to detect and prevent cyberattacks. For that you need dynamic brand intelligence. Brand intelligence is a precision solution that takes brand monitoring to the next level by surfacing the most relevant and actionable brand mentions. It’s not enough to know every mention of your brand on major social media platforms. To truly protect your brand, you need to strategically surface the company, product, and brand mentions that indicate your brand is potentially under attack. This includes intelligence around leaked credentials, copycat domains, phishing, and more. Dynamic brand intelligence at scale empowers security teams to proactively detect and take action against brand attacks in real time — before they damage the business. Recorded Future’s Brand Intelligence Module provides unmatched visibility into threats that were previously difficult or impossible for organizations to identify. By collecting data and intelligence from an unrivaled quantity and variety of open, closed, and technical sources, the brand intelligence module delivers the context you need to proactively defend your brand against cyberattacks. We even assist you in taking down attacks with built-in takedown services that go the last mile to simplify and expedite the removal of malicious content from the internet. Recorded Future combines analytics with human expertise to produce elite security intelligence that disrupts adversaries at scale. More than simply monitoring keywords, dynamic brand intelligence enables you to instantly identify relationships between emerging threats, your brands, and your infrastructure to deliver easy-to-consume brand intelligence. Proactively detect brand attacks as they surface — and take them down before they damage your business. Recorded Future makes it easy to protect your brand by empowering you to detect and take action against:Brand intelligence arms organizations with unmatched visibility to proactively protect their brand.

Dynamic risk scores paired with unprecedented context enable you to pivot and dig deeper into associated IPs and domains. Then, take immediate action by reporting and initiating a takedown request directly within Recorded Future’s platform.Data and Credential Leaks — Manually searching for leaked company data and credentials on paste sites and the dark web is next to impossible, not to mention dangerous. Recorded Future instantly processes information across these sites — including criminal forums that sell sensitive data — and instantly alerts you when there is a data or credential leak involving your brand. We even cache these posts for you to review and escalate.Infrastructure Risk — Continuous monitoring for threats against your infrastructure is the only way to proactively prevent attacks that could have otherwise launched undetected. Recorded Future delivers configurable alerts around your domains and IP addresses that empower you to swiftly secure your network when there are malicious mentions of your organization’s assets.Brand Attacks — As mentioned earlier, organizations often start their brand protection efforts with brand monitoring solutions. But closed criminal-access forums, social media channels, and foreign language sites are the real breeding ground for threat actors’ ploys. Most brand monitoring solutions don’t reach these corners of the web. Recorded Future does — instantly detecting, alerting you, and empowering you to take action — regardless of where your brand is mentioned in reference to a cyberattack.Industry Threats — If cybercriminals are targeting your industry or your peers, it is likely that they’ll be knocking on your door next. Recorded Future surfaces known and emerging threats to your industry and organizations like yours, empowering you to proactively defend against the very risks that threaten your brand and infrastructure.Company
